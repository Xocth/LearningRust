As you write more complex Rust programs, you’ll add
dependencies, and if you start a project using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much
easier to do.

$cargo new hello_cargo

This file is in the TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language) format, which is Cargo’s
configuration format.

If you started a project that doesn’t use Cargo, as we did with the “Hello, world!” project, you
can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the project code into the src directory
and create an appropriate Cargo.toml file.

From your hello_cargo directory, build your project by entering the following
command: $ cargo build


We just built a project with cargo build and ran it with ./target/debug/hello_cargo , but
we can also use cargo run to compile the code and then run the resultant executable all in
one command: $ cargo run

Cargo also provides a command called cargo check . This command quickly checks your
code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable.

Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:
• We can create a project using cargo new .
• We can build a project using cargo build .
• We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run .
• We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check .
• Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores
it in the target/debug directory.
